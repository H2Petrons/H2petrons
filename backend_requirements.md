### 2.5. Data Storage and Retrieval

**Requirement:** A robust database system to store all application data, including user information, research metadata, news content, forum posts, and event details.

**Details:**
- **Relational Database:** A relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) is generally suitable for structured data and complex relationships between entities (users, papers, comments).
- **Schema Design:** A well-designed database schema is crucial for data integrity, efficiency, and scalability.
- **Data Validation:** Server-side validation of all incoming data to ensure consistency and prevent malicious inputs.

### 2.6. API Design and Implementation

**Requirement:** All backend functionalities must be exposed through a well-documented and secure set of RESTful APIs.

**Details:**
- **RESTful Principles:** Adherence to REST principles for clear, stateless, and cacheable API endpoints.
- **JSON Format:** Data exchange primarily in JSON format.
- **Error Handling:** Consistent and informative error responses.
- **Security:** Implementation of API key management, rate limiting, and input sanitization to protect against common web vulnerabilities.

## 3. Proposed Technology Stack

Considering the requirements, a Python-based backend framework with a relational database is a strong candidate due to its flexibility, extensive libraries, and strong community support. Flask is an excellent choice for this project, offering a lightweight yet powerful framework for building RESTful APIs.

### 3.1. Backend Framework: Flask (Python)

**Why Flask?**
- **Lightweight and Flexible:** Flask is a micro-framework, meaning it provides the essentials without imposing rigid structures. This allows for greater flexibility in design and integration with other libraries.

The proposed backend architecture will follow a typical client-server model with a RESTful API interface:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)] -->|HTTP Requests| B(Flask Backend)
    B -->|API Endpoints| C{Business Logic}
    C -->|SQLAlchemy ORM| D[PostgreSQL Database]
    C -->|File Storage| E[File Server/Cloud Storage]
    B -->|Authentication| F[Flask-JWT-Extended]
    B -->|Serialization/Validation| G[Marshmallow]
```

- **Frontend:** The existing static HTML/CSS/JS files will make HTTP requests to the Flask backend APIs.
- **Flask Backend:** Receives requests, processes them using business logic, interacts with the database and file storage, and returns JSON responses.
- **PostgreSQL Database:** Stores all structured data.
- **File Server/Cloud Storage:** Stores research paper files.
- **Flask-JWT-Extended:** Manages user authentication and authorization.
- **Marshmallow:** Ensures data integrity and proper formatting for API requests and responses.

## 5. Next Steps
